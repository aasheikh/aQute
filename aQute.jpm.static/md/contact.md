About
=====
jpm4j stands for Just Another Package Manager for Java. It was born out of frustration
that in Ruby (gems), Node.js (npm), Perl (cspan), and others it is trivial to write 
a small or big program and then turn it into a command line executable on most operating
systems. It is kind of a paradox that the most portable language ever seems to be
hardest to deploy of all modern languages.
