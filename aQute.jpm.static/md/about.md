About
=====
jpm4j stands for Just Another Package Manager for Java. It was born out of frustration
that in Ruby (gems), Node.js (npm), Perl (cspan), and others it is trivial to deploy 
a program as a command line executable on most operating systems. It is a 
paradox that the most portable language ever, Java, seems to be the hardest to deploy 
of all modern languages.
