This project demonstrates how you can do continuous testing. 

Testing is described at http://www.aqute.biz/Bnd/Testing

In this project, we have a com.example.tests package that contains a single tests. This 
code is packaged in the aQute.testing.jar bundle. The manifest contains the Test-Cases
header that is calculated by a macro based on the content of the JAR. In short, all test
cases in the JAR are listed. 

In the -runbundles we add biz.aQute.junit. This bundle waits for active bundles and runs
their test cases, reporting their results in the testdir directory. These testreports are
useful in Hudson/Jenkins.

To test the tester, select bnd.bnd and then call up the context menu, select 

	Run As -> OSGi Run 
	
You should NOT select "OSGi Junit Test" as this will do a one shot test. In the run mode,
the framework will activate the biz.aQute.junit bundle. As we set continuous to true,
the tester will keep on running, waiting for bundles that become active, and then
running their test cases. 

Now very time you make a change in the test code, the tests are run again.
