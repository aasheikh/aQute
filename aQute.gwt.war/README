This project demonstrates the use of Karl Pauls PojoSR in a GWT example. You
will need bndtools installed.

The example takes the standard GWT sample code but backs it with an OSGi service.
The Dispatcher Servlet receives the request, finds the appropriate service and
then calls the service. 

This example includes two bundles:

  runtime - Provides Karl's code and a Dispatcher servlet
  demo    - An implementation of the GreetingService based on DS

The dependencies are stored in the WEB-INF/lib directory

The way of working is a bit cumbersome because you must copy your "bundles" to 
the war/WEB-INF/lib directory before you run the application. Every time ...
When running in debug, changes to the code are made in the process but when
this fails you have to copy again and restart. 
It should be possible to develop with bndtools and a real framework and get the
dynamic debugging but have not taken the time to make this work.
