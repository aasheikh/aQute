### Just another Package Manager for Java

JPM is a package manager for Java, running on Windows, Linux, MacOS, and other places where Java runs.
It provides a convenient way to share binaries and easily run them as commands in the command line,
clickable icons in the graphic user interface, or as system services.

JPM can be installed via [installers], [webstart](webstart.html), or via a 
simple one line install on *nix machines (including MacOs) as long as Java 5 or later is installed
and available as the "java" command:

> `(curl http://www.jpm4j.org/jpm4j.sh | sh)`
