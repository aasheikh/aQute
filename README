This project is a demonstration of using Vaadin with OSGi.

1) The project uses bndtools for development. You can download
   bndtools from http://njbartlett.github.com/bndtools.html
2) Checkout this git repository and import as a project into
   Eclipse with bndtools.
3) Do Run As ... OSGi Run

You can now open a web browser on http://localhost:8080/hello

The code is commented with explanations. First look at HelloWorld.java.
This is a component annotated with the bnd annotations. It uses the
Component Factory model of Declarative Services. The aQute.vaadin.core
bundle picks up any factory that has a factory id of "com.vaadin.Application/<alias>".
It will automatically create instances.

Next look at the AddressBook.java. This is the standard Vaadin example
that is actually easier than the original because no scaffolding is
used.

The DempApp.java shows how you can use OSGi to extend a tab with
contributions through services. Also here, the ComponentFactory model
is used however now with "com.vaadin.Component/<type>". In this
example type is "contribution".

Have fun!
