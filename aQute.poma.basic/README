This project shows a very simple trivial example but that is crucial to understand
why services work. It is the most basic example of a consumer, a provider and an
interface/API that keeps them uncoupled. This example shows how a service can be
used to tie them together without requiring any knowledge of the Consumer or Provider class,
only the Interface is relevant.

The aQute.poma.basic.consumer.jar provides the implementation of the client code. It has a 
reference on an com.poma.service.basic.Interface µservice. I.e. it gets activated when this
service is there.

The aQute.poma.basic.provider.jar is the implementation of the interface (API). It 
registers a com.poma.service.basic.Interface µservice when it gets started. Notice
it will not be activated until someone actually uses it.

The aQute.poma.basic.interface.jar just contains the interface. It is the only 
jar with an exported package (notice it is correctly versioned with packageinfo).
