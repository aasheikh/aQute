Speak
This project implements a speak service. It defines an API in the aQute.service.speak
package and implements it in the aQute.toolchest.speak.mac package. A Felix command
is implemented in the aQute.toolchest.felix.talker. There is also a Gossip component 
that listens to the log and tells you what's happening with your system. As usual, gossip
can quickly become annoying :-)

If you get want to add additional commands (Eclipse, Gogo, etc.) or additional
implementations (Windows, Linux), feel free to send me the code.
