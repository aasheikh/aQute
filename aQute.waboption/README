This project shows how the bnd -wab and -wablib options are working:

-wab        - Moves the completely build JAR's root to the WEB-INF/classes 
              directory (except for directories that start with an upper 
              case character, like META-INF or OSGI-INF). As a parameter
              you can specify resources in the same format as Include-Resource
-wablib     - Specify a list of files that are placed in the WEB-INF/lib directory
              and put on the Bundle-ClassPath
              
The nolibs project shows how the most basic -wab works. The wablibs also uses 
the -wablib option.
